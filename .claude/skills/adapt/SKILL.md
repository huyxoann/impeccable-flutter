Designs and iterates production-grade frontend interfaces. Real working code, committed design choices, exceptional craft.

## Setup

Before any design work or file edits:

1. Load context (PRODUCT.md / DESIGN.md) via the loader script.
2. Identify the register and load the matching register reference (brand.md or product.md).
3. **If the user invoked a sub-command (e.g. `craft`, `shape`, `audit`), load its reference file too.** This is non-negotiable: `craft` without `craft.md` loaded means you'll skip the shape-and-confirm step the user expects.

Skipping these produces generic output that ignores the project.

### 1. Context gathering

Two files, case-insensitive. The loader looks at the project root by default and falls back to `.agents/context/` and `docs/` if the root is clean. Override with `IMPECCABLE_CONTEXT_DIR=path/to/dir` (absolute or relative to cwd).

- **PRODUCT.md**: required. Users, brand, tone, anti-references, strategic principles.
- **DESIGN.md**: optional, strongly recommended. `ThemeData` strategies, `ColorScheme` choices, `TextTheme` rules, elevation, standard paddings, and Flutter component blueprints.

Load both in one call:

```bash
# Claude Code plugins run from a global cache. Replace the relative path below
# with the absolute path to this plugin's scripts directory before running.
node .claude/skills/impeccable-flutter/scripts/load-context.mjs
```

Consume the full JSON output. Never pipe through `head`, `tail`, `grep`, or `jq`. The output's `contextDir` field tells you where the files were resolved from.

If the output is already in this session's conversation history, don't re-run. Exceptions requiring a fresh load: you just ran `$impeccable-flutter init` or `$impeccable-flutter document` (they rewrite the files), or the user manually edited one.

If PRODUCT.md is missing, empty, or placeholder (`[TODO]` markers, <200 chars): run `$impeccable-flutter init`, then resume the user's original task with the fresh context. If the original task was `$impeccable-flutter craft`, resume into `$impeccable-flutter shape` before any implementation work.

If DESIGN.md is missing: nudge once per session (*"Run `$impeccable-flutter document` for more on-brand output"*), then proceed.

### 2. Register

Every design task is **brand** (marketing, landing, campaign, long-form content, portfolio: design IS the product) or **product** (app UI, admin, dashboard, tool: design SERVES the product).

Identify before designing. Priority: (1) cue in the task itself ("landing page" vs "dashboard"); (2) the surface in focus (the page, file, or route being worked on); (3) `register` field in PRODUCT.md. First match wins.

If PRODUCT.md lacks the `register` field (legacy), infer it once from its "Users" and "Product Purpose" sections, then cache the inferred value for the session. Suggest the user run `$impeccable-flutter init` to add the field explicitly.

Load the matching reference: [reference/brand.md](reference/brand.md) or [reference/product.md](reference/product.md). The shared design laws below apply to both.

## Shared design laws

Apply to every design, both registers. Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision: maximalism needs elaborate code, minimalism needs precision. Interpret creatively. Vary across projects; never converge on the same choices. GPT is capable of extraordinary work. Don't hold back.

### Color

- Use OKLCH. Reduce chroma as lightness approaches 0 or 100; high chroma at extremes looks garish.
- Never use `#000` or `#fff`. Tint every neutral toward the brand hue (chroma 0.005–0.01 is enough).
- Pick a **color strategy** before picking colors. Four steps on the commitment axis:
  - **Restrained**: tinted neutrals + one accent ≤10%. Product default; brand minimalism.
  - **Committed**: one saturated color carries 30–60% of the surface. Brand default for identity-driven pages.
  - **Full palette**: 3–4 named roles, each used deliberately. Brand campaigns; product data viz.
  - **Drenched**: the surface IS the color. Brand heroes, campaign pages.
- The "one accent ≤10%" rule is Restrained only. Committed / Full palette / Drenched exceed it on purpose. Don't collapse every design to Restrained by reflex.

### Theme

Dark vs. light is never a default. Not dark "because tools look cool dark." Not light "to be safe."

Before choosing, write one sentence of physical scene: who uses this, where, under what ambient light, in what mood. If the sentence doesn't force the answer, it's not concrete enough. Add detail until it does.

"Observability dashboard" does not force an answer. "SRE glancing at incident severity on a 27-inch monitor at 2am in a dim room" does. Run the sentence, not the category.

### Typography

- Cap body line length at 65–75ch.
- Hierarchy through scale + weight contrast (≥1.25 ratio between steps). Avoid flat scales.

### Layout

- Vary spacing for rhythm. Same padding everywhere is monotony.
- Cards are the lazy answer. Use them only when they're truly the best affordance. Nested cards are always wrong.
- Don't wrap everything in a container. Most things don't need one.

### Motion

- Don't animate CSS layout properties.
- Ease out with exponential curves (ease-out-quart / quint / expo). No bounce, no elastic.

### Absolute bans

Match-and-refuse. If you're about to write any of these, rewrite the element with different structure.

- **Side-stripe borders.** `border-left` or `border-right` greater than 1px as a colored accent on cards, list items, callouts, or alerts. Never intentional. Rewrite with full borders, background tints, leading numbers/icons, or nothing.
- **Gradient text.** `background-clip: text` combined with a gradient background. Decorative, never meaningful. Use a single solid color. Emphasis via weight or size.
- **Glassmorphism as default.** Blurs and glass cards used decoratively. Rare and purposeful, or nothing.
- **The hero-metric template.** Big number, small label, supporting stats, gradient accent. SaaS cliché.
- **Identical card grids.** Same-sized cards with icon + heading + text, repeated endlessly.
- **Modal as first thought.** Modals are usually laziness. Exhaust inline / progressive alternatives first.
- **The "GPT-border-and-shadow".** Very thin (≤1px) borders combined with wide, soft, low-opacity shadows. A generic LLM "premium" look. If you use a shadow, it must be part of a defined elevation system or a deliberate, high-contrast glow.

### Copy

- Every word earns its place. No restated headings, no intros that repeat the title.
- **No em dashes.** Use commas, colons, semicolons, periods, or parentheses. Also not `--`.
- **Banned "AI-isms" (Prose rules):** Never use "powerful", "seamless", "robust", "comprehensive", "dive in", "at its core", "look no further", or "elevate". If a feature is powerful, describe what it does with a concrete number or fact. If it's seamless, show the simplified workflow.

### The AI slop test

If someone could look at this interface and say "AI made that" without doubt, it's failed. Cross-register failures are the absolute bans above. Register-specific failures live in each reference.

**Category-reflex check.** Run at two altitudes; the second one catches what the first one misses.

- **First-order:** if someone could guess the theme + palette from the category alone ("observability → dark blue", "healthcare → white + teal", "finance → navy + gold", "crypto → neon on black"), it's the first training-data reflex. Rework the scene sentence and color strategy until the answer isn't obvious from the domain.
- **Second-order:** if someone could guess the aesthetic family from category-plus-anti-references ("AI workflow tool that's not SaaS-cream → editorial-typographic", "fintech that's not navy-and-gold → terminal-native dark mode"), it's the trap one tier deeper. The first reflex was avoided; the second wasn't. Rework until both answers are not obvious. The brand register's [reflex-reject aesthetic lanes](reference/brand.md) list catches the currently-saturated families.

### Routing rules

1. **No argument**: Run the Smart Recommendation Engine. Analyze the git tree, recent commits, and any existing critique snapshots. Propose the single most high-value next step (e.g., "The git history shows many typography tweaks; run `$impeccable-flutter typeset` to consolidate" or "No PRODUCT.md found; run `$impeccable-flutter init`"). Render the table above as a fallback menu.
2. **First word matches a command**: load its reference file and follow its instructions. Everything after the command name is the target.
3. **First word doesn't match**: general design invocation. Apply the setup steps, shared design laws, and the loaded register reference, using the full argument as context.

Setup (context gathering, register) is already loaded by then; sub-commands don't re-invoke `$impeccable-flutter`.

If the first word is `craft`, setup still runs first, but [reference/craft.md](reference/craft.md) owns the rest of the flow. If setup invokes `init` as a blocker, finish init, refresh context, then resume the original command and target.

## Pin / Unpin

**Pin** creates a standalone shortcut so `$<command>` invokes `$impeccable-flutter <command>` directly. **Unpin** removes it. The script writes to every harness directory present in the project.

```bash
# Claude Code plugins run from a global cache. Replace the relative path below
# with the absolute path to this plugin's scripts directory before running.
node .claude/skills/impeccable-flutter/scripts/pin.mjs <pin|unpin> <command>
```

Valid `<command>` is any command from the table above. Report the script's result concisely. Confirm the new shortcut on success, relay stderr verbatim on error.in** removes it. The script writes to every harness directory present in the project.

```bash
# Claude Code plugins run from a global cache. Replace the relative path below
# with the absolute path to this plugin's scripts directory before running.
node .claude/skills/impeccable-flutter/scripts/pin.mjs <pin|unpin> <command>
```

Valid `<command>` is any command from the table above. Report the script's result concisely. Confirm the new shortcut on success, relay stderr verbatim on error.

## Specific Instructions: adapt

> **Additional context needed**: target platforms/devices and usage contexts.

Adapt an existing design to a different context: another screen size, device, platform, or use case. The trap is treating adaptation as scaling. The job is rethinking the experience for the new context.


---

## Assess Adaptation Challenge

Understand what needs adaptation and why:

1. **Identify the source context**:
   - What was it designed for originally? (Desktop web? Mobile app?)
   - What assumptions were made? (Large screen? Mouse input? Fast connection?)
   - What works well in current context?

2. **Understand target context**:
   - **Device**: Mobile, tablet, desktop, TV, watch, print?
   - **Input method**: Touch, mouse, keyboard, voice, gamepad?
   - **Screen constraints**: Size, resolution, orientation?
   - **Connection**: Fast wifi, slow 3G, offline?
   - **Usage context**: On-the-go vs desk, quick glance vs focused reading?
   - **User expectations**: What do users expect on this platform?

3. **Identify adaptation challenges**:
   - What won't fit? (Content, navigation, features)
   - What won't work? (Hover states on touch, tiny touch targets)
   - What's inappropriate? (Desktop patterns on mobile, mobile patterns on desktop)

**CRITICAL**: Adaptation is rethinking the experience for the new context, not scaling pixels.

## Plan Adaptation Strategy

Create context-appropriate strategy:

### Mobile Adaptation (Desktop → Mobile)

**Layout Strategy**:
- Single column instead of multi-column
- Vertical stacking instead of side-by-side
- Full-width components instead of fixed widths
- Bottom navigation instead of top/side navigation

**Interaction Strategy**:
- Touch targets 44x44px minimum (not hover-dependent)
- Swipe gestures where appropriate (lists, carousels)
- Bottom sheets instead of dropdowns
- Thumbs-first design (controls within thumb reach)
- Larger tap areas with more spacing

**Content Strategy**:
- Progressive disclosure (don't show everything at once)
- Prioritize primary content (secondary content in tabs/accordions)
- Shorter text (more concise)
- Larger text (16px minimum)

**Navigation Strategy**:
- Hamburger menu or bottom navigation
- Reduce navigation complexity
- Sticky headers for context
- Back button in navigation flow

### Tablet Adaptation (Hybrid Approach)

**Layout Strategy**:
- Two-column layouts (not single or three-column)
- Side panels for secondary content
- Master-detail views (list + detail)
- Adaptive based on orientation (portrait vs landscape)

**Interaction Strategy**:
- Support both touch and pointer
- Touch targets 44x44px but allow denser layouts than phone
- Side navigation drawers
- Multi-column forms where appropriate

### Desktop Adaptation (Mobile → Desktop)

**Layout Strategy**:
- Multi-column layouts (use horizontal space)
- Side navigation always visible
- Multiple information panels simultaneously
- Fixed widths with max-width constraints (don't stretch to 4K)

**Interaction Strategy**:
- Hover states for additional information
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Right-click context menus
- Drag and drop where helpful
- Multi-select with Shift/Cmd

**Content Strategy**:
- Show more information upfront (less progressive disclosure)
- Data tables with many columns
- Richer visualizations
- More detailed descriptions

### Print Adaptation (Screen → Print)

**Layout Strategy**:
- Page breaks at logical points
- Remove navigation, footer, interactive elements
- Black and white (or limited color)
- Proper margins for binding

**Content Strategy**:
- Expand shortened content (show full URLs, hidden sections)
- Add page numbers, headers, footers
- Include metadata (print date, page title)
- Convert charts to print-friendly versions

### Email Adaptation (Web → Email)

**Layout Strategy**:
- Narrow width (600px max)
- Single column only
- Inline Flutter (no external stylesheets)
- Table-based layouts (for email client compatibility)

**Interaction Strategy**:
- Large, obvious CTAs (buttons not text links)
- No hover states (not reliable)
- Deep links to web app for complex interactions

## Implement Adaptations

Apply changes systematically:

### Responsive Breakpoints

Choose appropriate breakpoints:
- Mobile: 320px-767px
- Tablet: 768px-1023px
- Desktop: 1024px+
- Or content-driven breakpoints (where design breaks)

### Layout Adaptation Techniques

- **Flutter Grid/Flexbox**: Reflow layouts automatically
- **Container Queries**: Adapt based on container, not viewport
- **`clamp()`**: Fluid sizing between min and max
- **Media queries**: Different styles for different contexts
- **Display properties**: Show/hide elements per context

### Touch Adaptation

- Increase touch target sizes (44x44px minimum)
- Add more spacing between interactive elements
- Remove hover-dependent interactions
- Add touch feedback (ripples, highlights)
- Consider thumb zones (easier to reach bottom than top)

### Content Adaptation

- Use `display: none` sparingly (still downloads)
- Progressive enhancement (core content first, enhancements on larger screens)
- Lazy loading for off-screen content
- Responsive images (`srcset`, `picture` element)

### Navigation Adaptation

- Transform complex nav to hamburger/drawer on mobile
- Bottom nav bar for mobile apps
- Persistent side navigation on desktop
- Breadcrumbs on smaller screens for context

**IMPORTANT**: Test on real devices. Device emulation in DevTools is helpful but not perfect.

**NEVER**:
- Hide core functionality on mobile (if it matters, make it work)
- Assume desktop = powerful device (consider accessibility, older machines)
- Use different information architecture across contexts (confusing)
- Break user expectations for platform (mobile users expect mobile patterns)
- Forget landscape orientation on mobile/tablet
- Use generic breakpoints blindly (use content-driven breakpoints)
- Ignore touch on desktop (many desktop devices have touch)

## Verify Adaptations

Test thoroughly across contexts:

- **Real devices**: Test on actual phones, tablets, desktops
- **Different orientations**: Portrait and landscape
- **Different browsers**: Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- **Different OS**: iOS, Android, Windows, macOS
- **Different input methods**: Touch, mouse, keyboard
- **Edge cases**: Very small screens (320px), very large screens (4K)
- **Slow connections**: Test on throttled network

When the adaptation feels native to each context, hand off to `$impeccable-flutter polish` for the final pass.
