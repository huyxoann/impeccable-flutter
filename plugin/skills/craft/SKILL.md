Designs and iterates production-grade frontend interfaces. Real working code, committed design choices, exceptional craft.

## Setup

Before any design work or file edits:

1. Load context (PRODUCT.md / DESIGN.md) via the loader script.
2. Identify the register and load the matching register reference (brand.md or product.md).
3. **If the user invoked a sub-command (e.g. `craft`, `shape`, `audit`), load its reference file too.** This is non-negotiable: `craft` without `craft.md` loaded means you'll skip the shape-and-confirm step the user expects.

Skipping these produces generic output that ignores the project.

### 1. Context gathering

Two files, case-insensitive. The loader looks at the project root by default and falls back to `.agents/context/` and `docs/` if the root is clean. Override with `IMPECCABLE_CONTEXT_DIR=path/to/dir` (absolute or relative to cwd).

- **PRODUCT.md**: required. Users, brand, tone, anti-references, strategic principles.
- **DESIGN.md**: optional, strongly recommended. `ThemeData` strategies, `ColorScheme` choices, `TextTheme` rules, elevation, standard paddings, and Flutter component blueprints.

Load both in one call:

```bash
# Claude Code plugins run from a global cache. Replace the relative path below
# with the absolute path to this plugin's scripts directory before running.
node .claude/skills/impeccable-flutter/scripts/load-context.mjs
```

Consume the full JSON output. Never pipe through `head`, `tail`, `grep`, or `jq`. The output's `contextDir` field tells you where the files were resolved from.

If the output is already in this session's conversation history, don't re-run. Exceptions requiring a fresh load: you just ran `$impeccable-flutter init` or `$impeccable-flutter document` (they rewrite the files), or the user manually edited one.

If PRODUCT.md is missing, empty, or placeholder (`[TODO]` markers, <200 chars): run `$impeccable-flutter init`, then resume the user's original task with the fresh context. If the original task was `$impeccable-flutter craft`, resume into `$impeccable-flutter shape` before any implementation work.

If DESIGN.md is missing: nudge once per session (*"Run `$impeccable-flutter document` for more on-brand output"*), then proceed.

### 2. Register

Every design task is **brand** (marketing, landing, campaign, long-form content, portfolio: design IS the product) or **product** (app UI, admin, dashboard, tool: design SERVES the product).

Identify before designing. Priority: (1) cue in the task itself ("landing page" vs "dashboard"); (2) the surface in focus (the page, file, or route being worked on); (3) `register` field in PRODUCT.md. First match wins.

If PRODUCT.md lacks the `register` field (legacy), infer it once from its "Users" and "Product Purpose" sections, then cache the inferred value for the session. Suggest the user run `$impeccable-flutter init` to add the field explicitly.

Load the matching reference: [reference/brand.md](reference/brand.md) or [reference/product.md](reference/product.md). The shared design laws below apply to both.

## Shared design laws

Apply to every design, both registers. Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision: maximalism needs elaborate code, minimalism needs precision. Interpret creatively. Vary across projects; never converge on the same choices. GPT is capable of extraordinary work. Don't hold back.

### Color

- Use OKLCH. Reduce chroma as lightness approaches 0 or 100; high chroma at extremes looks garish.
- Never use `#000` or `#fff`. Tint every neutral toward the brand hue (chroma 0.005–0.01 is enough).
- Pick a **color strategy** before picking colors. Four steps on the commitment axis:
  - **Restrained**: tinted neutrals + one accent ≤10%. Product default; brand minimalism.
  - **Committed**: one saturated color carries 30–60% of the surface. Brand default for identity-driven pages.
  - **Full palette**: 3–4 named roles, each used deliberately. Brand campaigns; product data viz.
  - **Drenched**: the surface IS the color. Brand heroes, campaign pages.
- The "one accent ≤10%" rule is Restrained only. Committed / Full palette / Drenched exceed it on purpose. Don't collapse every design to Restrained by reflex.

### Theme

Dark vs. light is never a default. Not dark "because tools look cool dark." Not light "to be safe."

Before choosing, write one sentence of physical scene: who uses this, where, under what ambient light, in what mood. If the sentence doesn't force the answer, it's not concrete enough. Add detail until it does.

"Observability dashboard" does not force an answer. "SRE glancing at incident severity on a 27-inch monitor at 2am in a dim room" does. Run the sentence, not the category.

### Typography

- Cap body line length at 65–75ch.
- Hierarchy through scale + weight contrast (≥1.25 ratio between steps). Avoid flat scales.

### Layout

- Vary spacing for rhythm. Same padding everywhere is monotony.
- Cards are the lazy answer. Use them only when they're truly the best affordance. Nested cards are always wrong.
- Don't wrap everything in a container. Most things don't need one.

### Motion

- Don't animate CSS layout properties.
- Ease out with exponential curves (ease-out-quart / quint / expo). No bounce, no elastic.

### Absolute bans

Match-and-refuse. If you're about to write any of these, rewrite the element with different structure.

- **Side-stripe borders.** `border-left` or `border-right` greater than 1px as a colored accent on cards, list items, callouts, or alerts. Never intentional. Rewrite with full borders, background tints, leading numbers/icons, or nothing.
- **Gradient text.** `background-clip: text` combined with a gradient background. Decorative, never meaningful. Use a single solid color. Emphasis via weight or size.
- **Glassmorphism as default.** Blurs and glass cards used decoratively. Rare and purposeful, or nothing.
- **The hero-metric template.** Big number, small label, supporting stats, gradient accent. SaaS cliché.
- **Identical card grids.** Same-sized cards with icon + heading + text, repeated endlessly.
- **Modal as first thought.** Modals are usually laziness. Exhaust inline / progressive alternatives first.
- **The "GPT-border-and-shadow".** Very thin (≤1px) borders combined with wide, soft, low-opacity shadows. A generic LLM "premium" look. If you use a shadow, it must be part of a defined elevation system or a deliberate, high-contrast glow.

### Copy

- Every word earns its place. No restated headings, no intros that repeat the title.
- **No em dashes.** Use commas, colons, semicolons, periods, or parentheses. Also not `--`.
- **Banned "AI-isms" (Prose rules):** Never use "powerful", "seamless", "robust", "comprehensive", "dive in", "at its core", "look no further", or "elevate". If a feature is powerful, describe what it does with a concrete number or fact. If it's seamless, show the simplified workflow.

### The AI slop test

If someone could look at this interface and say "AI made that" without doubt, it's failed. Cross-register failures are the absolute bans above. Register-specific failures live in each reference.

**Category-reflex check.** Run at two altitudes; the second one catches what the first one misses.

- **First-order:** if someone could guess the theme + palette from the category alone ("observability → dark blue", "healthcare → white + teal", "finance → navy + gold", "crypto → neon on black"), it's the first training-data reflex. Rework the scene sentence and color strategy until the answer isn't obvious from the domain.
- **Second-order:** if someone could guess the aesthetic family from category-plus-anti-references ("AI workflow tool that's not SaaS-cream → editorial-typographic", "fintech that's not navy-and-gold → terminal-native dark mode"), it's the trap one tier deeper. The first reflex was avoided; the second wasn't. Rework until both answers are not obvious. The brand register's [reflex-reject aesthetic lanes](reference/brand.md) list catches the currently-saturated families.

### Routing rules

1. **No argument**: Run the Smart Recommendation Engine. Analyze the git tree, recent commits, and any existing critique snapshots. Propose the single most high-value next step (e.g., "The git history shows many typography tweaks; run `$impeccable-flutter typeset` to consolidate" or "No PRODUCT.md found; run `$impeccable-flutter init`"). Render the table above as a fallback menu.
2. **First word matches a command**: load its reference file and follow its instructions. Everything after the command name is the target.
3. **First word doesn't match**: general design invocation. Apply the setup steps, shared design laws, and the loaded register reference, using the full argument as context.

Setup (context gathering, register) is already loaded by then; sub-commands don't re-invoke `$impeccable-flutter`.

If the first word is `craft`, setup still runs first, but [reference/craft.md](reference/craft.md) owns the rest of the flow. If setup invokes `init` as a blocker, finish init, refresh context, then resume the original command and target.

## Pin / Unpin

**Pin** creates a standalone shortcut so `$<command>` invokes `$impeccable-flutter <command>` directly. **Unpin** removes it. The script writes to every harness directory present in the project.

```bash
# Claude Code plugins run from a global cache. Replace the relative path below
# with the absolute path to this plugin's scripts directory before running.
node .claude/skills/impeccable-flutter/scripts/pin.mjs <pin|unpin> <command>
```

Valid `<command>` is any command from the table above. Report the script's result concisely. Confirm the new shortcut on success, relay stderr verbatim on error.in** removes it. The script writes to every harness directory present in the project.

```bash
# Claude Code plugins run from a global cache. Replace the relative path below
# with the absolute path to this plugin's scripts directory before running.
node .claude/skills/impeccable-flutter/scripts/pin.mjs <pin|unpin> <command>
```

Valid `<command>` is any command from the table above. Report the script's result concisely. Confirm the new shortcut on success, relay stderr verbatim on error.

## Specific Instructions: craft

# Craft Flow

Build a feature with impeccable-flutter UX and UI quality: shape the design, land the visual direction, build real production code, and iterate until it meets a high-end studio bar.

Before writing code, you need: PRODUCT.md loaded, register identified and the matching reference loaded, and a confirmed design direction for this task.

### Gates: do not compress

Craft has **multiple user gates**, not one. 

1. **Shape brief confirmed** (Step 1)
2. **Direction questions answered** (codex.md Step A)
3. **Palette confirmed** (codex.md Step B)
4. **One mock direction approved or delegated** (codex.md Step D)

You must stop at every gate. **Shape confirmation alone is NOT a green light to start coding.** 

## Step 0: Project Foundation

Before shape, before code: figure out what kind of project you're working in.

Look at the working directory. Check for:

- **Flutter environment**: `pubspec.yaml`, `lib/main.dart`, `android/`, `ios/`. Use the project's existing structure. Do not start a parallel build. Whatever pipeline the project has, respect it.
- **Existing design system**: `lib/core/theme/`, `lib/widgets/`, `lib/components/`. Read what's there before adding to it.
- **Existing packages**: Are they using `go_router`, `flutter_animate`, specific state management (Riverpod/Provider)? **Use what's already in the project**.

If the directory is empty (greenfield), don't pick a state management pattern silently. Ask the user via the AskUserQuestion tool with sensible defaults.

## Step 1: Shape the Design

Run `$impeccable-flutter shape`, passing along whatever feature description the user provided. Shape is **required** for craft.

Present the shape output and stop. Wait for the user to confirm or override before writing code.

## Step 2: Load References

Based on the design brief's "Recommended References", consult the relevant files:
- [spatial-design.md](spatial-design.md) for layout (`Row`/`Column`/`Flex`) and spacing.
- [typography.md](typography.md) for `TextTheme` hierarchy.
- [interaction-design.md](interaction-design.md) for interactions.
- [motion-design.md](motion-design.md) for `flutter_animate` timing.
- [color-and-contrast.md](color-and-contrast.md) for `ColorScheme` usage.

## Step 3: Visual Direction & Assets (Harness-Gated)

If the harness has **native image generation**, this step is mandatory. **Stop and load [codex.md](codex.md)**. 

If the harness lacks native image generation, **state in one line that the visual-direction-by-generation step is being skipped**, then proceed. Implement directly from the brief.

## Step 4: Build to Production Quality

Implement the feature following the design brief. Build in passes so structure, visual system, states, motion, and responsive behavior each get deliberate attention.

### Production bar

- **Real content.** No placeholder copy, dead buttons, or unused scaffold at presentation time.
- **Preserve the approved direction.** 
- **Semantic first.** Proper use of `Semantics` widgets if building custom controls.
- **Deliberate spacing and alignment.** No default gaps, arbitrary `Padding`, or accidental optical misalignment. Use `SizedBox` or `spacing` properties.
- **Intentional typography.** Clear hierarchy via `Theme.of(context).textTheme`. No overflow at any width.
- **Realistic state coverage.** Default, hovered, focused, pressed, disabled, loading, error, success, empty.
- **Finished interaction quality.** Touch targets (44px min), feedback timing (`InkWell`/haptics), state transitions.
- **Respect the build pipeline.** Edit `.dart` source files. Don't write generated code straight to outputs.
- **Optimized imagery.** Correct dimensions, caching (`cached_network_image`), `BoxFit.cover`.
- **Premium motion.** Use `flutter_animate` or explicit `AnimationController`s when they improve the experience. Bound expensive paint operations.
- **Maintainable.** Reusable `StatelessWidget` patterns, clear component boundaries.
- **Technically clean.** `flutter analyze` passes, no `RenderFlex` overflow errors.
- **Ask when uncertain.** Don't guess.

## Step 5: Iterate Visually

Look at what you built. Use whatever tools you have to verify the visual outcome (emulator screenshots, logs, or asking the user).

Actively check: responsive behavior (`LayoutBuilder`), every state (empty / error / loading / edge), craft details (spacing, alignment, hierarchy, contrast, motion timing), performance basics (no jank).

## Step 6: Present

Present the result to the user:
- Show the feature in its primary state.
- Walk through the key states.
- Explain design decisions connecting back to the brief.
- Note limitations.
- Ask: "What's working? What isn't?"
