Designs and iterates production-grade frontend interfaces. Real working code, committed design choices, exceptional craft.

## Setup

Before any design work or file edits:

1. Load context (PRODUCT.md / DESIGN.md) via the loader script.
2. Identify the register and load the matching register reference (brand.md or product.md).
3. **If the user invoked a sub-command (e.g. `craft`, `shape`, `audit`), load its reference file too.** This is non-negotiable: `craft` without `craft.md` loaded means you'll skip the shape-and-confirm step the user expects.

Skipping these produces generic output that ignores the project.

### 1. Context gathering

Two files, case-insensitive. The loader looks at the project root by default and falls back to `.agents/context/` and `docs/` if the root is clean. Override with `IMPECCABLE_CONTEXT_DIR=path/to/dir` (absolute or relative to cwd).

- **PRODUCT.md**: required. Users, brand, tone, anti-references, strategic principles.
- **DESIGN.md**: optional, strongly recommended. `ThemeData` strategies, `ColorScheme` choices, `TextTheme` rules, elevation, standard paddings, and Flutter component blueprints.

Load both in one call:

```bash
# Claude Code plugins run from a global cache. Replace the relative path below
# with the absolute path to this plugin's scripts directory before running.
node .claude/skills/impeccable-flutter/scripts/load-context.mjs
```

Consume the full JSON output. Never pipe through `head`, `tail`, `grep`, or `jq`. The output's `contextDir` field tells you where the files were resolved from.

If the output is already in this session's conversation history, don't re-run. Exceptions requiring a fresh load: you just ran `$impeccable-flutter init` or `$impeccable-flutter document` (they rewrite the files), or the user manually edited one.

If PRODUCT.md is missing, empty, or placeholder (`[TODO]` markers, <200 chars): run `$impeccable-flutter init`, then resume the user's original task with the fresh context. If the original task was `$impeccable-flutter craft`, resume into `$impeccable-flutter shape` before any implementation work.

If DESIGN.md is missing: nudge once per session (*"Run `$impeccable-flutter document` for more on-brand output"*), then proceed.

### 2. Register

Every design task is **brand** (marketing, landing, campaign, long-form content, portfolio: design IS the product) or **product** (app UI, admin, dashboard, tool: design SERVES the product).

Identify before designing. Priority: (1) cue in the task itself ("landing page" vs "dashboard"); (2) the surface in focus (the page, file, or route being worked on); (3) `register` field in PRODUCT.md. First match wins.

If PRODUCT.md lacks the `register` field (legacy), infer it once from its "Users" and "Product Purpose" sections, then cache the inferred value for the session. Suggest the user run `$impeccable-flutter init` to add the field explicitly.

Load the matching reference: [reference/brand.md](reference/brand.md) or [reference/product.md](reference/product.md). The shared design laws below apply to both.

## Shared design laws

Apply to every design, both registers. Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision: maximalism needs elaborate code, minimalism needs precision. Interpret creatively. Vary across projects; never converge on the same choices. GPT is capable of extraordinary work. Don't hold back.

### Color

- Use OKLCH. Reduce chroma as lightness approaches 0 or 100; high chroma at extremes looks garish.
- Never use `#000` or `#fff`. Tint every neutral toward the brand hue (chroma 0.005–0.01 is enough).
- Pick a **color strategy** before picking colors. Four steps on the commitment axis:
  - **Restrained**: tinted neutrals + one accent ≤10%. Product default; brand minimalism.
  - **Committed**: one saturated color carries 30–60% of the surface. Brand default for identity-driven pages.
  - **Full palette**: 3–4 named roles, each used deliberately. Brand campaigns; product data viz.
  - **Drenched**: the surface IS the color. Brand heroes, campaign pages.
- The "one accent ≤10%" rule is Restrained only. Committed / Full palette / Drenched exceed it on purpose. Don't collapse every design to Restrained by reflex.

### Theme

Dark vs. light is never a default. Not dark "because tools look cool dark." Not light "to be safe."

Before choosing, write one sentence of physical scene: who uses this, where, under what ambient light, in what mood. If the sentence doesn't force the answer, it's not concrete enough. Add detail until it does.

"Observability dashboard" does not force an answer. "SRE glancing at incident severity on a 27-inch monitor at 2am in a dim room" does. Run the sentence, not the category.

### Typography

- Cap body line length at 65–75ch.
- Hierarchy through scale + weight contrast (≥1.25 ratio between steps). Avoid flat scales.

### Layout

- Vary spacing for rhythm. Same padding everywhere is monotony.
- Cards are the lazy answer. Use them only when they're truly the best affordance. Nested cards are always wrong.
- Don't wrap everything in a container. Most things don't need one.

### Motion

- Don't animate CSS layout properties.
- Ease out with exponential curves (ease-out-quart / quint / expo). No bounce, no elastic.

### Absolute bans

Match-and-refuse. If you're about to write any of these, rewrite the element with different structure.

- **Side-stripe borders.** `border-left` or `border-right` greater than 1px as a colored accent on cards, list items, callouts, or alerts. Never intentional. Rewrite with full borders, background tints, leading numbers/icons, or nothing.
- **Gradient text.** `background-clip: text` combined with a gradient background. Decorative, never meaningful. Use a single solid color. Emphasis via weight or size.
- **Glassmorphism as default.** Blurs and glass cards used decoratively. Rare and purposeful, or nothing.
- **The hero-metric template.** Big number, small label, supporting stats, gradient accent. SaaS cliché.
- **Identical card grids.** Same-sized cards with icon + heading + text, repeated endlessly.
- **Modal as first thought.** Modals are usually laziness. Exhaust inline / progressive alternatives first.
- **The "GPT-border-and-shadow".** Very thin (≤1px) borders combined with wide, soft, low-opacity shadows. A generic LLM "premium" look. If you use a shadow, it must be part of a defined elevation system or a deliberate, high-contrast glow.

### Copy

- Every word earns its place. No restated headings, no intros that repeat the title.
- **No em dashes.** Use commas, colons, semicolons, periods, or parentheses. Also not `--`.
- **Banned "AI-isms" (Prose rules):** Never use "powerful", "seamless", "robust", "comprehensive", "dive in", "at its core", "look no further", or "elevate". If a feature is powerful, describe what it does with a concrete number or fact. If it's seamless, show the simplified workflow.

### The AI slop test

If someone could look at this interface and say "AI made that" without doubt, it's failed. Cross-register failures are the absolute bans above. Register-specific failures live in each reference.

**Category-reflex check.** Run at two altitudes; the second one catches what the first one misses.

- **First-order:** if someone could guess the theme + palette from the category alone ("observability → dark blue", "healthcare → white + teal", "finance → navy + gold", "crypto → neon on black"), it's the first training-data reflex. Rework the scene sentence and color strategy until the answer isn't obvious from the domain.
- **Second-order:** if someone could guess the aesthetic family from category-plus-anti-references ("AI workflow tool that's not SaaS-cream → editorial-typographic", "fintech that's not navy-and-gold → terminal-native dark mode"), it's the trap one tier deeper. The first reflex was avoided; the second wasn't. Rework until both answers are not obvious. The brand register's [reflex-reject aesthetic lanes](reference/brand.md) list catches the currently-saturated families.

### Routing rules

1. **No argument**: Run the Smart Recommendation Engine. Analyze the git tree, recent commits, and any existing critique snapshots. Propose the single most high-value next step (e.g., "The git history shows many typography tweaks; run `$impeccable-flutter typeset` to consolidate" or "No PRODUCT.md found; run `$impeccable-flutter init`"). Render the table above as a fallback menu.
2. **First word matches a command**: load its reference file and follow its instructions. Everything after the command name is the target.
3. **First word doesn't match**: general design invocation. Apply the setup steps, shared design laws, and the loaded register reference, using the full argument as context.

Setup (context gathering, register) is already loaded by then; sub-commands don't re-invoke `$impeccable-flutter`.

If the first word is `craft`, setup still runs first, but [reference/craft.md](reference/craft.md) owns the rest of the flow. If setup invokes `init` as a blocker, finish init, refresh context, then resume the original command and target.

## Pin / Unpin

**Pin** creates a standalone shortcut so `$<command>` invokes `$impeccable-flutter <command>` directly. **Unpin** removes it. The script writes to every harness directory present in the project.

```bash
# Claude Code plugins run from a global cache. Replace the relative path below
# with the absolute path to this plugin's scripts directory before running.
node .claude/skills/impeccable-flutter/scripts/pin.mjs <pin|unpin> <command>
```

Valid `<command>` is any command from the table above. Report the script's result concisely. Confirm the new shortcut on success, relay stderr verbatim on error.in** removes it. The script writes to every harness directory present in the project.

```bash
# Claude Code plugins run from a global cache. Replace the relative path below
# with the absolute path to this plugin's scripts directory before running.
node .claude/skills/impeccable-flutter/scripts/pin.mjs <pin|unpin> <command>
```

Valid `<command>` is any command from the table above. Report the script's result concisely. Confirm the new shortcut on success, relay stderr verbatim on error.

## Specific Instructions: colorize

> **Additional context needed**: existing brand colors.

Replace timid grayscale or single-accent designs with a strategic palette: pick a color strategy, choose a hue family that fits the brand, then apply color with intent. More color ≠ better. Strategic color beats rainbow vomit.

---

## Register

Brand: palette IS voice. Pick a color strategy first per SKILL.md (Restrained / Committed / Full palette / Drenched) and follow its dosage. Committed, Full palette, and Drenched deliberately exceed the ≤10% rule; that rule is Restrained only. Unexpected combinations are allowed; a dominant color can own the page when the chosen strategy calls for it.

Product: semantic-first and almost always Restrained. Accent color is reserved for primary action, current selection, and state indicators. Not decoration. Every color has a consistent meaning across every screen.

---

## Assess Color Opportunity

Analyze the current state and identify opportunities:

1. **Understand current state**:
   - **Color absence**: Pure grayscale? Limited neutrals? One timid accent?
   - **Missed opportunities**: Where could color add meaning, hierarchy, or delight?
   - **Context**: What's appropriate for this domain and audience?
   - **Brand**: Are there existing brand colors we should use?

2. **Identify where color adds value**:
   - **Semantic meaning**: Success (green), error (red), warning (yellow/orange), info (blue)
   - **Hierarchy**: Drawing attention to important elements
   - **Categorization**: Different sections, types, or states
   - **Emotional tone**: Warmth, energy, trust, creativity
   - **Wayfinding**: Helping users navigate and understand structure
   - **Delight**: Moments of visual interest and personality

If any of these are unclear from the codebase, STOP and ask the user to clarify what you cannot infer.

**CRITICAL**: More color ≠ better. Strategic color beats rainbow vomit every time. Every color should have a purpose.

## Plan Color Strategy

Create a purposeful color introduction plan:

- **Color palette**: What colors match the brand/context? (Choose 2-4 colors max beyond neutrals)
- **Dominant color**: Which color owns 60% of colored elements?
- **Accent colors**: Which colors provide contrast and highlights? (30% and 10%)
- **Application strategy**: Where does each color appear and why?

**IMPORTANT**: Color should enhance hierarchy and meaning, not create chaos. Less is more when it matters more.

## Introduce Color Strategically

Add color systematically across these dimensions:

### Semantic Color
- **State indicators**:
  - Success: Green tones (emerald, forest, mint)
  - Error: Red/pink tones (rose, crimson, coral)
  - Warning: Orange/amber tones
  - Info: Blue tones (sky, ocean, indigo)
  - Neutral: Gray/slate for inactive states

- **Status badges**: Colored backgrounds or borders for states (active, pending, completed, etc.)
- **Progress indicators**: Colored bars, rings, or charts showing completion or health

### Accent Color Application
- **Primary actions**: Color the most important buttons/CTAs (`ElevatedButton`)
- **Links**: Add color to clickable text (`TextButton` or `InkWell`)
- **Icons**: Colorize key icons for recognition and personality
- **Headers/titles**: Add color to section headers or key labels
- **Hover states**: Introduce color on interaction (`WidgetState.hovered`)

### Background & Surfaces
- **Tinted backgrounds**: Replace pure gray (`Colors.grey[50]`) with warm or cool tinted neutrals using `Color.lerp(Colors.white, primaryColor, 0.02)`.
- **Colored sections**: Use subtle background colors to separate areas
- **Cards & surfaces**: Tint cards or surfaces slightly for warmth

### Data Visualization
- **Charts & graphs**: Use color to encode categories or values
- **Heatmaps**: Color intensity shows density or importance
- **Comparison**: Color coding for different datasets or timeframes

### Borders & Accents
- **Hairline borders**: 1px colored borders on full perimeter.
- **Underlines**: Color underlines for emphasis or active states
- **Dividers**: Subtle colored `Divider`s instead of standard gray lines
- **Focus rings**: Colored focus indicators matching brand
- **Surface tints**: A 4-8% background wash of the accent color instead of a stripe

**NEVER**: Use a colored accent stripe on just one side of a card to indicate status. If you want to mark a card as "active" or "warning", use a full hairline border, a background tint, a leading glyph, or a numbered prefix. Not a side stripe.

### Typography Color
- **Colored headings**: Use brand colors for section headings (maintain contrast)
- **Highlight text**: Color for emphasis or categories
- **Labels & tags**: Small colored labels for metadata or categories

### Decorative Elements
- **Illustrations**: Add colored illustrations or icons
- **Shapes**: Geometric shapes in brand colors as background elements
- **Gradients**: Colorful gradient overlays (`LinearGradient`, `RadialGradient`)
- **Blobs/organic shapes**: Soft colored shapes for visual interest

## Balance & Refinement

Ensure color addition improves rather than overwhelms:

### Maintain Hierarchy
- **Dominant color** (60%): Primary brand color or most used accent
- **Secondary color** (30%): Supporting color for variety
- **Accent color** (10%): High contrast for key moments
- **Neutrals** (remaining): Gray/black/white for structure

### Accessibility
- **Contrast ratios**: Ensure WCAG compliance (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI components)
- **Don't rely on color alone**: Use icons, labels, or patterns alongside color
- **Test for color blindness**: Verify red/green combinations work for all users

### Cohesion
- **Consistent palette**: Use colors from defined `ColorScheme`, not arbitrary choices
- **Systematic application**: Same color meanings throughout (green always = success)
- **Temperature consistency**: Warm palette stays warm, cool stays cool

**NEVER**:
- Use every color in the rainbow (choose 2-4 colors beyond neutrals)
- Apply color randomly without semantic meaning
- Put gray text on colored backgrounds. It looks washed out; use a darker shade of the background color or transparency instead
- Use pure gray for neutrals. Add subtle color tint (warm or cool) for depth
- Use pure black (`Colors.black`) or pure white (`Colors.white`) for large areas without nuance
- Violate WCAG contrast requirements
- Use color as the only indicator (accessibility issue)
- Make everything colorful (defeats the purpose)
- Default to purple-blue gradients (AI slop aesthetic)

## Verify Color Addition

Test that colorization improves the experience:

- **Better hierarchy**: Does color guide attention appropriately?
- **Clearer meaning**: Does color help users understand states/categories?
- **More engaging**: Does the interface feel warmer and more inviting?
- **Still accessible**: Do all color combinations meet WCAG standards?
- **Not overwhelming**: Is color balanced and purposeful?

When the palette earns its place, hand off to `$impeccable-flutter polish` for the final pass.
