Designs and iterates production-grade frontend interfaces. Real working code, committed design choices, exceptional craft.

## Setup

Before any design work or file edits:

1. Load context (PRODUCT.md / DESIGN.md) via the loader script.
2. Identify the register and load the matching register reference (brand.md or product.md).
3. **If the user invoked a sub-command (e.g. `craft`, `shape`, `audit`), load its reference file too.** This is non-negotiable: `craft` without `craft.md` loaded means you'll skip the shape-and-confirm step the user expects.

Skipping these produces generic output that ignores the project.

### 1. Context gathering

Two files, case-insensitive. The loader looks at the project root by default and falls back to `.agents/context/` and `docs/` if the root is clean. Override with `IMPECCABLE_CONTEXT_DIR=path/to/dir` (absolute or relative to cwd).

- **PRODUCT.md**: required. Users, brand, tone, anti-references, strategic principles.
- **DESIGN.md**: optional, strongly recommended. `ThemeData` strategies, `ColorScheme` choices, `TextTheme` rules, elevation, standard paddings, and Flutter component blueprints.

Load both in one call:

```bash
# Claude Code plugins run from a global cache. Replace the relative path below
# with the absolute path to this plugin's scripts directory before running.
node .claude/skills/impeccable-flutter/scripts/load-context.mjs
```

Consume the full JSON output. Never pipe through `head`, `tail`, `grep`, or `jq`. The output's `contextDir` field tells you where the files were resolved from.

If the output is already in this session's conversation history, don't re-run. Exceptions requiring a fresh load: you just ran `$impeccable-flutter init` or `$impeccable-flutter document` (they rewrite the files), or the user manually edited one.

If PRODUCT.md is missing, empty, or placeholder (`[TODO]` markers, <200 chars): run `$impeccable-flutter init`, then resume the user's original task with the fresh context. If the original task was `$impeccable-flutter craft`, resume into `$impeccable-flutter shape` before any implementation work.

If DESIGN.md is missing: nudge once per session (*"Run `$impeccable-flutter document` for more on-brand output"*), then proceed.

### 2. Register

Every design task is **brand** (marketing, landing, campaign, long-form content, portfolio: design IS the product) or **product** (app UI, admin, dashboard, tool: design SERVES the product).

Identify before designing. Priority: (1) cue in the task itself ("landing page" vs "dashboard"); (2) the surface in focus (the page, file, or route being worked on); (3) `register` field in PRODUCT.md. First match wins.

If PRODUCT.md lacks the `register` field (legacy), infer it once from its "Users" and "Product Purpose" sections, then cache the inferred value for the session. Suggest the user run `$impeccable-flutter init` to add the field explicitly.

Load the matching reference: [reference/brand.md](reference/brand.md) or [reference/product.md](reference/product.md). The shared design laws below apply to both.

## Shared design laws

Apply to every design, both registers. Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision: maximalism needs elaborate code, minimalism needs precision. Interpret creatively. Vary across projects; never converge on the same choices. GPT is capable of extraordinary work. Don't hold back.

### Color

- Use OKLCH. Reduce chroma as lightness approaches 0 or 100; high chroma at extremes looks garish.
- Never use `#000` or `#fff`. Tint every neutral toward the brand hue (chroma 0.005–0.01 is enough).
- Pick a **color strategy** before picking colors. Four steps on the commitment axis:
  - **Restrained**: tinted neutrals + one accent ≤10%. Product default; brand minimalism.
  - **Committed**: one saturated color carries 30–60% of the surface. Brand default for identity-driven pages.
  - **Full palette**: 3–4 named roles, each used deliberately. Brand campaigns; product data viz.
  - **Drenched**: the surface IS the color. Brand heroes, campaign pages.
- The "one accent ≤10%" rule is Restrained only. Committed / Full palette / Drenched exceed it on purpose. Don't collapse every design to Restrained by reflex.

### Theme

Dark vs. light is never a default. Not dark "because tools look cool dark." Not light "to be safe."

Before choosing, write one sentence of physical scene: who uses this, where, under what ambient light, in what mood. If the sentence doesn't force the answer, it's not concrete enough. Add detail until it does.

"Observability dashboard" does not force an answer. "SRE glancing at incident severity on a 27-inch monitor at 2am in a dim room" does. Run the sentence, not the category.

### Typography

- Cap body line length at 65–75ch.
- Hierarchy through scale + weight contrast (≥1.25 ratio between steps). Avoid flat scales.

### Layout

- Vary spacing for rhythm. Same padding everywhere is monotony.
- Cards are the lazy answer. Use them only when they're truly the best affordance. Nested cards are always wrong.
- Don't wrap everything in a container. Most things don't need one.

### Motion

- Don't animate CSS layout properties.
- Ease out with exponential curves (ease-out-quart / quint / expo). No bounce, no elastic.

### Absolute bans

Match-and-refuse. If you're about to write any of these, rewrite the element with different structure.

- **Side-stripe borders.** `border-left` or `border-right` greater than 1px as a colored accent on cards, list items, callouts, or alerts. Never intentional. Rewrite with full borders, background tints, leading numbers/icons, or nothing.
- **Gradient text.** `background-clip: text` combined with a gradient background. Decorative, never meaningful. Use a single solid color. Emphasis via weight or size.
- **Glassmorphism as default.** Blurs and glass cards used decoratively. Rare and purposeful, or nothing.
- **The hero-metric template.** Big number, small label, supporting stats, gradient accent. SaaS cliché.
- **Identical card grids.** Same-sized cards with icon + heading + text, repeated endlessly.
- **Modal as first thought.** Modals are usually laziness. Exhaust inline / progressive alternatives first.
- **The "GPT-border-and-shadow".** Very thin (≤1px) borders combined with wide, soft, low-opacity shadows. A generic LLM "premium" look. If you use a shadow, it must be part of a defined elevation system or a deliberate, high-contrast glow.

### Copy

- Every word earns its place. No restated headings, no intros that repeat the title.
- **No em dashes.** Use commas, colons, semicolons, periods, or parentheses. Also not `--`.
- **Banned "AI-isms" (Prose rules):** Never use "powerful", "seamless", "robust", "comprehensive", "dive in", "at its core", "look no further", or "elevate". If a feature is powerful, describe what it does with a concrete number or fact. If it's seamless, show the simplified workflow.

### The AI slop test

If someone could look at this interface and say "AI made that" without doubt, it's failed. Cross-register failures are the absolute bans above. Register-specific failures live in each reference.

**Category-reflex check.** Run at two altitudes; the second one catches what the first one misses.

- **First-order:** if someone could guess the theme + palette from the category alone ("observability → dark blue", "healthcare → white + teal", "finance → navy + gold", "crypto → neon on black"), it's the first training-data reflex. Rework the scene sentence and color strategy until the answer isn't obvious from the domain.
- **Second-order:** if someone could guess the aesthetic family from category-plus-anti-references ("AI workflow tool that's not SaaS-cream → editorial-typographic", "fintech that's not navy-and-gold → terminal-native dark mode"), it's the trap one tier deeper. The first reflex was avoided; the second wasn't. Rework until both answers are not obvious. The brand register's [reflex-reject aesthetic lanes](reference/brand.md) list catches the currently-saturated families.

### Routing rules

1. **No argument**: Run the Smart Recommendation Engine. Analyze the git tree, recent commits, and any existing critique snapshots. Propose the single most high-value next step (e.g., "The git history shows many typography tweaks; run `$impeccable-flutter typeset` to consolidate" or "No PRODUCT.md found; run `$impeccable-flutter init`"). Render the table above as a fallback menu.
2. **First word matches a command**: load its reference file and follow its instructions. Everything after the command name is the target.
3. **First word doesn't match**: general design invocation. Apply the setup steps, shared design laws, and the loaded register reference, using the full argument as context.

Setup (context gathering, register) is already loaded by then; sub-commands don't re-invoke `$impeccable-flutter`.

If the first word is `craft`, setup still runs first, but [reference/craft.md](reference/craft.md) owns the rest of the flow. If setup invokes `init` as a blocker, finish init, refresh context, then resume the original command and target.

## Pin / Unpin

**Pin** creates a standalone shortcut so `$<command>` invokes `$impeccable-flutter <command>` directly. **Unpin** removes it. The script writes to every harness directory present in the project.

```bash
# Claude Code plugins run from a global cache. Replace the relative path below
# with the absolute path to this plugin's scripts directory before running.
node .claude/skills/impeccable-flutter/scripts/pin.mjs <pin|unpin> <command>
```

Valid `<command>` is any command from the table above. Report the script's result concisely. Confirm the new shortcut on success, relay stderr verbatim on error.in** removes it. The script writes to every harness directory present in the project.

```bash
# Claude Code plugins run from a global cache. Replace the relative path below
# with the absolute path to this plugin's scripts directory before running.
node .claude/skills/impeccable-flutter/scripts/pin.mjs <pin|unpin> <command>
```

Valid `<command>` is any command from the table above. Report the script's result concisely. Confirm the new shortcut on success, relay stderr verbatim on error.

## Specific Instructions: audit

Run systematic **technical** quality checks and generate a comprehensive report. Don't fix issues; document them for other commands to address.

This is a code-level audit, not a design critique. Check what's measurable and verifiable in the implementation.

## Diagnostic Scan

Run comprehensive checks across 5 dimensions. Score each dimension 0-4 using the criteria below.

### 1. Accessibility (A11y)

**Check for**:
- **Contrast issues**: Text contrast ratios < 4.5:1 (or 7:1 for AAA).
- **Semantic Dart**: Using bare `GestureDetector`s without `Semantics` wrappers, or lacking `SemanticLabel` on critical icon-only buttons (`IconButton(tooltip: ...)`).
- **Screen reader flow**: `MergeSemantics` missing on complex custom components.
- **Focus Indicators**: No visible feedback for keyboard focus (`WidgetState.focused`).
- **Form issues**: Inputs without labels or clear error messaging.

**Score 0-4**: 0=Inaccessible, 1=Major gaps, 2=Partial, 3=Good (mostly accessible), 4=Excellent (full Semantics support).

### 2. Performance

**Check for**:
- **Rebuild thrashing**: Calling `setState` at the root of a large Widget Tree instead of isolating state.
- **Expensive animations**: Casual use of `saveLayer` triggers (`Opacity` + multiple children, `ShaderMask`, `ClipPath`) that visibly drop frames in Profile mode.
- **Missing optimization**: Long lists using `Column` instead of `ListView.builder`. Lack of `const` constructors on static widgets.
- **Bundle size**: Unused heavy asset files, overly large fonts loaded in `pubspec.yaml`.
- **Repaint Boundaries**: Missing `RepaintBoundary` on static elements next to heavy animations.

**Score 0-4**: 0=Severe issues (jank, unoptimized everything), 1=Major problems (no `const`, heavy lists), 2=Partial (some optimization, gaps remain), 3=Good (mostly optimized), 4=Excellent (fast, lean, well-optimized).

### 3. Theming

**Check for**:
- **Hard-coded colors**: `Colors.blue` or `Color(0xFF...)` sprinkled in UI instead of `Theme.of(context).colorScheme`.
- **Hard-coded TextStyles**: `TextStyle(fontSize: 16)` instead of `Theme.of(context).textTheme`.
- **Broken dark mode**: Missing dark mode variants in `MaterialApp(darkTheme: ...)`.
- **Inconsistent tokens**: Using raw values instead of established `AppSpacing` or token constants.

**Score 0-4**: 0=No theming (hard-coded everything), 1=Minimal tokens (mostly hard-coded), 2=Partial (tokens exist but inconsistently used), 3=Good (tokens used, minor hard-coded values), 4=Excellent (full `ThemeData` system).

### 4. Responsive Design

**Check for**:
- **Fixed widths**: Hard-coded `width: 400` that throws `RenderFlex` overflow errors on small screens.
- **Touch targets**: Interactive elements < 44x44px.
- **Orientation handling**: UI breaks in landscape mode.
- **Text scaling**: `RenderFlex` overflow errors when device text size is set to 200%.
- **Missing breakpoints**: `LayoutBuilder` missing for tablet/desktop adaptations.

**Score 0-4**: 0=Mobile-only (breaks on tablet/landscape), 1=Major issues (some `LayoutBuilder`s, many failures), 2=Partial (works, rough edges), 3=Good (responsive, minor touch target or overflow issues), 4=Excellent (fluid, handles text scaling).

### 5. Anti-Patterns (CRITICAL)

Check against ALL the **DON'T** guidelines from the parent impeccable-flutter skill (already loaded in this context). Look for AI slop tells (AI color palette, gradient text, glassmorphism, hero metrics, card grids, generic fonts) and general design anti-patterns (gray on color, nested cards, bounce easing, redundant copy).

**Score 0-4**: 0=AI slop gallery (5+ tells), 1=Heavy AI aesthetic (3-4 tells), 2=Some tells (1-2 noticeable), 3=Mostly clean (subtle issues only), 4=No AI tells (distinctive, intentional design).

### Audit Health Score

| # | Dimension | Score | Key Finding |
|---|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Accessibility | ? | [most critical a11y issue or "--"] |
| 2 | Performance | ? | |
| 3 | Responsive Design | ? | |
| 4 | Theming | ? | |
| 5 | Anti-Patterns | ? | |

**Rating bands**: 18-20 Excellent (minor polish), 14-17 Good (address weak dimensions), 10-13 Acceptable (significant work needed), 6-9 Poor (major overhaul), 0-5 Critical (fundamental issues).

### Anti-Patterns Verdict
**Start here.** Pass/fail: Does this look AI-generated? List specific tells. Be brutally honest.

### Executive Summary
- Audit Health Score: **??/20** ([rating band])
- Total issues found (count by severity: P0/P1/P2/P3)
- Top 3-5 critical issues
- Recommended next steps

### Detailed Findings by Severity

Tag every issue with **P0-P3 severity**:
- **P0 Blocking**: Prevents task completion or causes exceptions (`RenderFlex` overflow). Fix immediately.
- **P1 Major**: Significant difficulty, WCAG violation, or heavy jank. Fix before release.
- **P2 Minor**: Annoyance, workaround exists. Fix in next pass.
- **P3 Polish**: Nice-to-fix, no real user impact. Fix if time permits.

For each issue, document:
- **[P?] Issue name**
- **Location**: Widget, file, line
- **Category**: Accessibility / Performance / Theming / Responsive / Anti-Pattern
- **Impact**: How it affects users
- **Recommendation**: How to fix it in Dart/Flutter
- **Suggested command**: Which command to use.

### Patterns & Systemic Issues

Identify recurring problems that indicate systemic gaps rather than one-off mistakes:
- "Hard-coded colors appear in 15+ widgets, should use `Theme.of(context)`"
- "Touch targets consistently too small (<44px) throughout."

### Positive Findings

Note what's working well: good practices to maintain and replicate.

## Recommended Actions

List recommended commands in priority order (P0 first, then P1, then P2):

1. **[P?] `$command-name`**: Brief description (specific context from audit findings)
2. **[P?] `$command-name`**: Brief description (specific context)

**Rules**: Only recommend commands from the impeccable-flutter suite. End with `$impeccable-flutter polish` as the final step.

After presenting the summary, tell the user:

> You can ask me to run these one at a time, all at once, or in any order you prefer.
>
> Re-run `$impeccable-flutter audit` after fixes to see your score improve.

**IMPORTANT**: Be thorough but actionable. Too many P3 issues creates noise. Focus on what actually matters.
