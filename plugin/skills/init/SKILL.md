Designs and iterates production-grade frontend interfaces. Real working code, committed design choices, exceptional craft.

## Setup

Before any design work or file edits:

1. Load context (PRODUCT.md / DESIGN.md) via the loader script.
2. Identify the register and load the matching register reference (brand.md or product.md).
3. **If the user invoked a sub-command (e.g. `craft`, `shape`, `audit`), load its reference file too.** This is non-negotiable: `craft` without `craft.md` loaded means you'll skip the shape-and-confirm step the user expects.

Skipping these produces generic output that ignores the project.

### 1. Context gathering

Two files, case-insensitive. The loader looks at the project root by default and falls back to `.agents/context/` and `docs/` if the root is clean. Override with `IMPECCABLE_CONTEXT_DIR=path/to/dir` (absolute or relative to cwd).

- **PRODUCT.md**: required. Users, brand, tone, anti-references, strategic principles.
- **DESIGN.md**: optional, strongly recommended. `ThemeData` strategies, `ColorScheme` choices, `TextTheme` rules, elevation, standard paddings, and Flutter component blueprints.

Load both in one call:

```bash
# Claude Code plugins run from a global cache. Replace the relative path below
# with the absolute path to this plugin's scripts directory before running.
node .claude/skills/impeccable-flutter/scripts/load-context.mjs
```

Consume the full JSON output. Never pipe through `head`, `tail`, `grep`, or `jq`. The output's `contextDir` field tells you where the files were resolved from.

If the output is already in this session's conversation history, don't re-run. Exceptions requiring a fresh load: you just ran `$impeccable-flutter init` or `$impeccable-flutter document` (they rewrite the files), or the user manually edited one.

If PRODUCT.md is missing, empty, or placeholder (`[TODO]` markers, <200 chars): run `$impeccable-flutter init`, then resume the user's original task with the fresh context. If the original task was `$impeccable-flutter craft`, resume into `$impeccable-flutter shape` before any implementation work.

If DESIGN.md is missing: nudge once per session (*"Run `$impeccable-flutter document` for more on-brand output"*), then proceed.

### 2. Register

Every design task is **brand** (marketing, landing, campaign, long-form content, portfolio: design IS the product) or **product** (app UI, admin, dashboard, tool: design SERVES the product).

Identify before designing. Priority: (1) cue in the task itself ("landing page" vs "dashboard"); (2) the surface in focus (the page, file, or route being worked on); (3) `register` field in PRODUCT.md. First match wins.

If PRODUCT.md lacks the `register` field (legacy), infer it once from its "Users" and "Product Purpose" sections, then cache the inferred value for the session. Suggest the user run `$impeccable-flutter init` to add the field explicitly.

Load the matching reference: [reference/brand.md](reference/brand.md) or [reference/product.md](reference/product.md). The shared design laws below apply to both.

## Shared design laws

Apply to every design, both registers. Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision: maximalism needs elaborate code, minimalism needs precision. Interpret creatively. Vary across projects; never converge on the same choices. GPT is capable of extraordinary work. Don't hold back.

### Color

- Use OKLCH. Reduce chroma as lightness approaches 0 or 100; high chroma at extremes looks garish.
- Never use `#000` or `#fff`. Tint every neutral toward the brand hue (chroma 0.005–0.01 is enough).
- Pick a **color strategy** before picking colors. Four steps on the commitment axis:
  - **Restrained**: tinted neutrals + one accent ≤10%. Product default; brand minimalism.
  - **Committed**: one saturated color carries 30–60% of the surface. Brand default for identity-driven pages.
  - **Full palette**: 3–4 named roles, each used deliberately. Brand campaigns; product data viz.
  - **Drenched**: the surface IS the color. Brand heroes, campaign pages.
- The "one accent ≤10%" rule is Restrained only. Committed / Full palette / Drenched exceed it on purpose. Don't collapse every design to Restrained by reflex.

### Theme

Dark vs. light is never a default. Not dark "because tools look cool dark." Not light "to be safe."

Before choosing, write one sentence of physical scene: who uses this, where, under what ambient light, in what mood. If the sentence doesn't force the answer, it's not concrete enough. Add detail until it does.

"Observability dashboard" does not force an answer. "SRE glancing at incident severity on a 27-inch monitor at 2am in a dim room" does. Run the sentence, not the category.

### Typography

- Cap body line length at 65–75ch.
- Hierarchy through scale + weight contrast (≥1.25 ratio between steps). Avoid flat scales.

### Layout

- Vary spacing for rhythm. Same padding everywhere is monotony.
- Cards are the lazy answer. Use them only when they're truly the best affordance. Nested cards are always wrong.
- Don't wrap everything in a container. Most things don't need one.

### Motion

- Don't animate CSS layout properties.
- Ease out with exponential curves (ease-out-quart / quint / expo). No bounce, no elastic.

### Absolute bans

Match-and-refuse. If you're about to write any of these, rewrite the element with different structure.

- **Side-stripe borders.** `border-left` or `border-right` greater than 1px as a colored accent on cards, list items, callouts, or alerts. Never intentional. Rewrite with full borders, background tints, leading numbers/icons, or nothing.
- **Gradient text.** `background-clip: text` combined with a gradient background. Decorative, never meaningful. Use a single solid color. Emphasis via weight or size.
- **Glassmorphism as default.** Blurs and glass cards used decoratively. Rare and purposeful, or nothing.
- **The hero-metric template.** Big number, small label, supporting stats, gradient accent. SaaS cliché.
- **Identical card grids.** Same-sized cards with icon + heading + text, repeated endlessly.
- **Modal as first thought.** Modals are usually laziness. Exhaust inline / progressive alternatives first.
- **The "GPT-border-and-shadow".** Very thin (≤1px) borders combined with wide, soft, low-opacity shadows. A generic LLM "premium" look. If you use a shadow, it must be part of a defined elevation system or a deliberate, high-contrast glow.

### Copy

- Every word earns its place. No restated headings, no intros that repeat the title.
- **No em dashes.** Use commas, colons, semicolons, periods, or parentheses. Also not `--`.
- **Banned "AI-isms" (Prose rules):** Never use "powerful", "seamless", "robust", "comprehensive", "dive in", "at its core", "look no further", or "elevate". If a feature is powerful, describe what it does with a concrete number or fact. If it's seamless, show the simplified workflow.

### The AI slop test

If someone could look at this interface and say "AI made that" without doubt, it's failed. Cross-register failures are the absolute bans above. Register-specific failures live in each reference.

**Category-reflex check.** Run at two altitudes; the second one catches what the first one misses.

- **First-order:** if someone could guess the theme + palette from the category alone ("observability → dark blue", "healthcare → white + teal", "finance → navy + gold", "crypto → neon on black"), it's the first training-data reflex. Rework the scene sentence and color strategy until the answer isn't obvious from the domain.
- **Second-order:** if someone could guess the aesthetic family from category-plus-anti-references ("AI workflow tool that's not SaaS-cream → editorial-typographic", "fintech that's not navy-and-gold → terminal-native dark mode"), it's the trap one tier deeper. The first reflex was avoided; the second wasn't. Rework until both answers are not obvious. The brand register's [reflex-reject aesthetic lanes](reference/brand.md) list catches the currently-saturated families.

### Routing rules

1. **No argument**: Run the Smart Recommendation Engine. Analyze the git tree, recent commits, and any existing critique snapshots. Propose the single most high-value next step (e.g., "The git history shows many typography tweaks; run `$impeccable-flutter typeset` to consolidate" or "No PRODUCT.md found; run `$impeccable-flutter init`"). Render the table above as a fallback menu.
2. **First word matches a command**: load its reference file and follow its instructions. Everything after the command name is the target.
3. **First word doesn't match**: general design invocation. Apply the setup steps, shared design laws, and the loaded register reference, using the full argument as context.

Setup (context gathering, register) is already loaded by then; sub-commands don't re-invoke `$impeccable-flutter`.

If the first word is `craft`, setup still runs first, but [reference/craft.md](reference/craft.md) owns the rest of the flow. If setup invokes `init` as a blocker, finish init, refresh context, then resume the original command and target.

## Pin / Unpin

**Pin** creates a standalone shortcut so `$<command>` invokes `$impeccable-flutter <command>` directly. **Unpin** removes it. The script writes to every harness directory present in the project.

```bash
# Claude Code plugins run from a global cache. Replace the relative path below
# with the absolute path to this plugin's scripts directory before running.
node .claude/skills/impeccable-flutter/scripts/pin.mjs <pin|unpin> <command>
```

Valid `<command>` is any command from the table above. Report the script's result concisely. Confirm the new shortcut on success, relay stderr verbatim on error.in** removes it. The script writes to every harness directory present in the project.

```bash
# Claude Code plugins run from a global cache. Replace the relative path below
# with the absolute path to this plugin's scripts directory before running.
node .claude/skills/impeccable-flutter/scripts/pin.mjs <pin|unpin> <command>
```

Valid `<command>` is any command from the table above. Report the script's result concisely. Confirm the new shortcut on success, relay stderr verbatim on error.

## Specific Instructions: init

# Init Flow

Gathers design context for a project and writes two complementary files at the project root:

- **PRODUCT.md** (strategic): root project file for register, target users, product purpose, brand personality, anti-references, strategic design principles. Answers "who/what/why".
- **DESIGN.md** (visual): root project file for visual theme, color palette, typography, components, layout. Follows the [Google Stitch DESIGN.md format](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/docs/design-md/format/). Answers "how it looks".

Every other impeccable-flutter command reads these files before doing any work.

## Step 1: Load current state

Run the shared loader first so you know what already exists:

```bash
node .claude/skills/impeccable-flutter/scripts/load-context.mjs
```

The output tells you whether PRODUCT.md and/or DESIGN.md already exist. If `migrated: true`, legacy `.impeccable-flutter.md` was auto-renamed to `PRODUCT.md`. Mention this once to the user.

Decision tree:
- **Neither file exists (empty project or no context yet)**: do Steps 2-4 (write PRODUCT.md), then decide on DESIGN.md based on whether there's code to analyze.
- **PRODUCT.md exists, DESIGN.md missing**: skip to Step 5 and offer to run `$impeccable-flutter document` for DESIGN.md.
- **PRODUCT.md exists but has no `## Register` section (legacy)**: add it. Infer a hypothesis from the codebase (see Step 2), confirm with the user, write the field.
- **Both exist**: STOP and use Codex's structured user-input/question tool when available; if unavailable, ask directly in chat to clarify what you cannot infer. Ask which file to refresh. Skip the one the user doesn't want changed.
- **Just DESIGN.md exists (unusual)**: do Steps 2-4 to produce PRODUCT.md.

Never silently overwrite an existing file. Always confirm first.

If init was invoked as a setup blocker by another command, such as `$impeccable-flutter craft landing page`, pause that command here. Complete init, re-run the loader, then resume the original command with the freshly loaded context. For craft, resume into shape next; init creates project context, but it is not a substitute for the task-specific shape interview and confirmed design brief.

## Step 2: Explore the codebase

Before asking questions, thoroughly scan the project to discover what you can:

- **README and docs**: Project purpose, target audience, any stated goals
- **Package.json / config files**: Tech stack, dependencies, existing design libraries
- **Existing components**: Current design patterns, spacing, typography in use
- **Brand assets**: Logos, favicons, color values already defined
- **Design tokens / Flutter variables**: Existing color palettes, font stacks, spacing scales
- **Any style guides or brand documentation**

Also form a **register hypothesis** from what you find:

- Brand signals: `/`, `/about`, `/pricing`, `/blog/*`, `/docs/*`, hero sections, big typography, scroll-driven sections, landing-page-shaped content.
- Product signals: `/app/*`, `/dashboard`, `/settings`, `/(auth)`, forms, data tables, side/top nav, app-shell components.

Register is a hypothesis at this point, not a decision; Step 3 confirms it.

Note what you've learned and what remains unclear. This exploration feeds both PRODUCT.md and DESIGN.md.

## Step 3: Ask strategic questions (for PRODUCT.md)

STOP and use Codex's structured user-input/question tool when available; if unavailable, ask directly in chat to clarify what you cannot infer. Ask only about what you couldn't infer from the codebase.

### Interview mode, not confirmation mode

If the repo is empty or the user's brief is sparse, run a short interview before proposing PRODUCT.md. Do **not** turn a one-sentence request into a complete inferred PRODUCT.md and ask for blanket confirmation.

- Use the harness's structured question tool when one exists. Otherwise, ask directly in chat and stop.
- Ask **2-3 questions per round**, then wait for answers.
- Use inferred answers as hypotheses or options, not as finished facts.
- Complete at least one real user-answer round before drafting PRODUCT.md, unless every required answer is directly discoverable from repo docs.
- Round 1 should establish register, users/purpose, and desired outcome.
- Round 2 should establish brand personality or references, anti-references, and accessibility needs.

### Minimum viable interview

Ask enough to complete PRODUCT.md. At minimum, cover register confirmation, users and purpose, brand personality, anti-references, and accessibility needs unless each answer is directly discoverable from repo context. After at least one interview round, you may propose inferred answers, but the user must confirm them before you write PRODUCT.md. Never synthesize PRODUCT.md from the original task prompt alone.

### Register (ask first; it shapes everything below)

Every design task is either **brand** (marketing, landing, campaign, long-form content, portfolio: design IS the product) or **product** (app UI, admin, dashboards, tools: design SERVES the product).

If Step 2 produced a clear hypothesis, lead with it: *"From the codebase, this looks like a [brand / product] surface. Does that match your intent, or should we treat it differently?"*

If the signal is genuinely split (e.g. a product with a big marketing landing), STOP and use Codex's structured user-input/question tool when available; if unavailable, ask directly in chat to clarify what you cannot infer. Ask which register describes the **primary** surface. The register can be overridden per task later, but PRODUCT.md carries one default.

### Users & Purpose
- Who uses this? What's their context when using it?
- What job are they trying to get done?
- For brand: what emotions should the interface evoke? (confidence, delight, calm, urgency)
- For product: what workflow are they in? What's the primary task on any given screen?

### Brand & Personality
- How would you describe the brand personality in 3 words?
- Reference sites or apps that capture the right feel? What specifically about them?
  - For brand, push for real-world references in the right lane (tech-minimal, editorial-magazine, consumer-warm, brutalist-grid, etc.), not generic "modern" adjectives.
  - For product, push for category best-tool references (Linear, Figma, Notion, Raycast, Stripe).
- What should this explicitly NOT look like? Any anti-references?

### Accessibility & Inclusion
- Specific accessibility requirements? (WCAG level, known user needs)
- Considerations for reduced motion, color blindness, or other accommodations?

Skip questions where the answer is already clear. **Do NOT ask about colors, fonts, radii, or visual styling here.** Those belong in DESIGN.md, not PRODUCT.md.

## Step 4: Write PRODUCT.md

Write PRODUCT.md only after the user has confirmed the strategic answers from Step 3. If an inferred answer is uncertain or unconfirmed, ask before writing.

Synthesize into a strategic document:

```markdown
# Product

## Register

product

## Users
[Who they are, their context, the job to be done]

## Product Purpose
[What this product does, why it exists, what success looks like]

## Brand Personality
[Voice, tone, 3-word personality, emotional goals]

## Anti-references
[What this should NOT look like. Specific bad-example sites or patterns to avoid.]

## Design Principles
[3-5 strategic principles derived from the conversation. Principles like "practice what you preach", "show, don't tell", "expert confidence". NOT visual rules like "use OKLCH" or "magenta accent".]

## Accessibility & Inclusion
[WCAG level, known user needs, considerations]
```

Register is either `brand` or `product` as a bare value. No prose, no commentary.

Write to `PROJECT_ROOT/PRODUCT.md`. If `.impeccable-flutter.md` existed, the loader already renamed it; merge into that content rather than starting from scratch.

## Step 5: Decide on DESIGN.md

Offer `$impeccable-flutter document` either way. Two paths:

- **Code exists** (Flutter tokens, components, a running site): "I can generate a DESIGN.md that captures your visual system (colors, typography, components) so variants stay on-brand. Want to do that now?"
- **Pre-implementation** (empty project): "I can seed a starter DESIGN.md from five quick questions about color strategy, type direction, motion energy, and references. You can re-run once there's code, to capture the real tokens. Want to do that now?"

If the user agrees, delegate to `$impeccable-flutter document` (it auto-detects scan vs seed). Load its reference and follow that flow.

If the user prefers to skip, mention they can run `$impeccable-flutter document` any time later.

## Step 6: Confirm and wrap up

Summarize:
- Register captured (brand / product)
- What was written (PRODUCT.md, DESIGN.md, or both)
- The 3-5 strategic principles from PRODUCT.md that will guide future work
- If DESIGN.md is pending, remind the user how to generate it later

**Critical: re-run the loader to refresh session context.** After writing PRODUCT.md, run `node .claude/skills/impeccable-flutter/scripts/load-context.mjs` one final time and let its full JSON output land in conversation. This ensures subsequent commands in this session use the freshly-written PRODUCT.md, not a stale earlier version.

If init was invoked as a blocker by another impeccable-flutter command (e.g. the user ran `$impeccable-flutter polish` with no PRODUCT.md), resume that original task now with the fresh context.

Optionally STOP and use Codex's structured user-input/question tool when available; if unavailable, ask directly in chat to clarify what you cannot infer. Ask whether they'd like a brief summary of PRODUCT.md appended to AGENTS.md for easier agent reference. If yes, append a short **Design Context** pointer section there.
