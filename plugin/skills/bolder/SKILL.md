Designs and iterates production-grade frontend interfaces. Real working code, committed design choices, exceptional craft.

## Setup

Before any design work or file edits:

1. Load context (PRODUCT.md / DESIGN.md) via the loader script.
2. Identify the register and load the matching register reference (brand.md or product.md).
3. **If the user invoked a sub-command (e.g. `craft`, `shape`, `audit`), load its reference file too.** This is non-negotiable: `craft` without `craft.md` loaded means you'll skip the shape-and-confirm step the user expects.

Skipping these produces generic output that ignores the project.

### 1. Context gathering

Two files, case-insensitive. The loader looks at the project root by default and falls back to `.agents/context/` and `docs/` if the root is clean. Override with `IMPECCABLE_CONTEXT_DIR=path/to/dir` (absolute or relative to cwd).

- **PRODUCT.md**: required. Users, brand, tone, anti-references, strategic principles.
- **DESIGN.md**: optional, strongly recommended. `ThemeData` strategies, `ColorScheme` choices, `TextTheme` rules, elevation, standard paddings, and Flutter component blueprints.

Load both in one call:

```bash
# Claude Code plugins run from a global cache. Replace the relative path below
# with the absolute path to this plugin's scripts directory before running.
node .claude/skills/impeccable-flutter/scripts/load-context.mjs
```

Consume the full JSON output. Never pipe through `head`, `tail`, `grep`, or `jq`. The output's `contextDir` field tells you where the files were resolved from.

If the output is already in this session's conversation history, don't re-run. Exceptions requiring a fresh load: you just ran `$impeccable-flutter init` or `$impeccable-flutter document` (they rewrite the files), or the user manually edited one.

If PRODUCT.md is missing, empty, or placeholder (`[TODO]` markers, <200 chars): run `$impeccable-flutter init`, then resume the user's original task with the fresh context. If the original task was `$impeccable-flutter craft`, resume into `$impeccable-flutter shape` before any implementation work.

If DESIGN.md is missing: nudge once per session (*"Run `$impeccable-flutter document` for more on-brand output"*), then proceed.

### 2. Register

Every design task is **brand** (marketing, landing, campaign, long-form content, portfolio: design IS the product) or **product** (app UI, admin, dashboard, tool: design SERVES the product).

Identify before designing. Priority: (1) cue in the task itself ("landing page" vs "dashboard"); (2) the surface in focus (the page, file, or route being worked on); (3) `register` field in PRODUCT.md. First match wins.

If PRODUCT.md lacks the `register` field (legacy), infer it once from its "Users" and "Product Purpose" sections, then cache the inferred value for the session. Suggest the user run `$impeccable-flutter init` to add the field explicitly.

Load the matching reference: [reference/brand.md](reference/brand.md) or [reference/product.md](reference/product.md). The shared design laws below apply to both.

## Shared design laws

Apply to every design, both registers. Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision: maximalism needs elaborate code, minimalism needs precision. Interpret creatively. Vary across projects; never converge on the same choices. GPT is capable of extraordinary work. Don't hold back.

### Color

- Use OKLCH. Reduce chroma as lightness approaches 0 or 100; high chroma at extremes looks garish.
- Never use `#000` or `#fff`. Tint every neutral toward the brand hue (chroma 0.005–0.01 is enough).
- Pick a **color strategy** before picking colors. Four steps on the commitment axis:
  - **Restrained**: tinted neutrals + one accent ≤10%. Product default; brand minimalism.
  - **Committed**: one saturated color carries 30–60% of the surface. Brand default for identity-driven pages.
  - **Full palette**: 3–4 named roles, each used deliberately. Brand campaigns; product data viz.
  - **Drenched**: the surface IS the color. Brand heroes, campaign pages.
- The "one accent ≤10%" rule is Restrained only. Committed / Full palette / Drenched exceed it on purpose. Don't collapse every design to Restrained by reflex.

### Theme

Dark vs. light is never a default. Not dark "because tools look cool dark." Not light "to be safe."

Before choosing, write one sentence of physical scene: who uses this, where, under what ambient light, in what mood. If the sentence doesn't force the answer, it's not concrete enough. Add detail until it does.

"Observability dashboard" does not force an answer. "SRE glancing at incident severity on a 27-inch monitor at 2am in a dim room" does. Run the sentence, not the category.

### Typography

- Cap body line length at 65–75ch.
- Hierarchy through scale + weight contrast (≥1.25 ratio between steps). Avoid flat scales.

### Layout

- Vary spacing for rhythm. Same padding everywhere is monotony.
- Cards are the lazy answer. Use them only when they're truly the best affordance. Nested cards are always wrong.
- Don't wrap everything in a container. Most things don't need one.

### Motion

- Don't animate CSS layout properties.
- Ease out with exponential curves (ease-out-quart / quint / expo). No bounce, no elastic.

### Absolute bans

Match-and-refuse. If you're about to write any of these, rewrite the element with different structure.

- **Side-stripe borders.** `border-left` or `border-right` greater than 1px as a colored accent on cards, list items, callouts, or alerts. Never intentional. Rewrite with full borders, background tints, leading numbers/icons, or nothing.
- **Gradient text.** `background-clip: text` combined with a gradient background. Decorative, never meaningful. Use a single solid color. Emphasis via weight or size.
- **Glassmorphism as default.** Blurs and glass cards used decoratively. Rare and purposeful, or nothing.
- **The hero-metric template.** Big number, small label, supporting stats, gradient accent. SaaS cliché.
- **Identical card grids.** Same-sized cards with icon + heading + text, repeated endlessly.
- **Modal as first thought.** Modals are usually laziness. Exhaust inline / progressive alternatives first.
- **The "GPT-border-and-shadow".** Very thin (≤1px) borders combined with wide, soft, low-opacity shadows. A generic LLM "premium" look. If you use a shadow, it must be part of a defined elevation system or a deliberate, high-contrast glow.

### Copy

- Every word earns its place. No restated headings, no intros that repeat the title.
- **No em dashes.** Use commas, colons, semicolons, periods, or parentheses. Also not `--`.
- **Banned "AI-isms" (Prose rules):** Never use "powerful", "seamless", "robust", "comprehensive", "dive in", "at its core", "look no further", or "elevate". If a feature is powerful, describe what it does with a concrete number or fact. If it's seamless, show the simplified workflow.

### The AI slop test

If someone could look at this interface and say "AI made that" without doubt, it's failed. Cross-register failures are the absolute bans above. Register-specific failures live in each reference.

**Category-reflex check.** Run at two altitudes; the second one catches what the first one misses.

- **First-order:** if someone could guess the theme + palette from the category alone ("observability → dark blue", "healthcare → white + teal", "finance → navy + gold", "crypto → neon on black"), it's the first training-data reflex. Rework the scene sentence and color strategy until the answer isn't obvious from the domain.
- **Second-order:** if someone could guess the aesthetic family from category-plus-anti-references ("AI workflow tool that's not SaaS-cream → editorial-typographic", "fintech that's not navy-and-gold → terminal-native dark mode"), it's the trap one tier deeper. The first reflex was avoided; the second wasn't. Rework until both answers are not obvious. The brand register's [reflex-reject aesthetic lanes](reference/brand.md) list catches the currently-saturated families.

### Routing rules

1. **No argument**: Run the Smart Recommendation Engine. Analyze the git tree, recent commits, and any existing critique snapshots. Propose the single most high-value next step (e.g., "The git history shows many typography tweaks; run `$impeccable-flutter typeset` to consolidate" or "No PRODUCT.md found; run `$impeccable-flutter init`"). Render the table above as a fallback menu.
2. **First word matches a command**: load its reference file and follow its instructions. Everything after the command name is the target.
3. **First word doesn't match**: general design invocation. Apply the setup steps, shared design laws, and the loaded register reference, using the full argument as context.

Setup (context gathering, register) is already loaded by then; sub-commands don't re-invoke `$impeccable-flutter`.

If the first word is `craft`, setup still runs first, but [reference/craft.md](reference/craft.md) owns the rest of the flow. If setup invokes `init` as a blocker, finish init, refresh context, then resume the original command and target.

## Pin / Unpin

**Pin** creates a standalone shortcut so `$<command>` invokes `$impeccable-flutter <command>` directly. **Unpin** removes it. The script writes to every harness directory present in the project.

```bash
# Claude Code plugins run from a global cache. Replace the relative path below
# with the absolute path to this plugin's scripts directory before running.
node .claude/skills/impeccable-flutter/scripts/pin.mjs <pin|unpin> <command>
```

Valid `<command>` is any command from the table above. Report the script's result concisely. Confirm the new shortcut on success, relay stderr verbatim on error.in** removes it. The script writes to every harness directory present in the project.

```bash
# Claude Code plugins run from a global cache. Replace the relative path below
# with the absolute path to this plugin's scripts directory before running.
node .claude/skills/impeccable-flutter/scripts/pin.mjs <pin|unpin> <command>
```

Valid `<command>` is any command from the table above. Report the script's result concisely. Confirm the new shortcut on success, relay stderr verbatim on error.

## Specific Instructions: bolder

When asked for "bolder," AI defaults to the same tired tricks: cyan/purple gradients, glassmorphism, neon accents on dark backgrounds, gradient text on metrics. These are the opposite of bold. Reject them first, then increase visual impact and personality through stronger hierarchy, committed scale, and decisive type.

---

## Register

Brand: "bolder" means distinctive. Extreme scale, unexpected color, typographic risk, committed POV.

Product: "bolder" rarely means theatrics; those undermine trust. It means stronger hierarchy, clearer weight contrast, one sharper accent, more committed density. The amplification is in clarity, not drama.

---

## Assess Current State

Analyze what makes the design feel too safe or boring:

1. **Identify weakness sources**:
   - **Generic choices**: System fonts, basic colors, standard layouts
   - **Timid scale**: Everything is medium-sized with no drama
   - **Low contrast**: Everything has similar visual weight
   - **Static**: No motion, no energy, no life
   - **Predictable**: Standard patterns with no surprises
   - **Flat hierarchy**: Nothing stands out or commands attention

2. **Understand the context**:
   - What's the brand personality? (How far can we push?)
   - What's the purpose? (Marketing can be bolder than financial dashboards)
   - Who's the audience? (What will resonate?)
   - What are the constraints? (Brand guidelines, accessibility, performance)

If any of these are unclear from the codebase, STOP and use Codex's structured user-input/question tool when available; if unavailable, ask directly in chat to clarify what you cannot infer.

**CRITICAL**: "Bolder" doesn't mean chaotic or garish. It means distinctive, memorable, and confident. Think intentional drama, not random chaos.

**WARNING - AI SLOP TRAP**: Review ALL the DON'T guidelines from the parent impeccable-flutter skill (already loaded in this context) before proceeding. Bold means distinctive, not "more effects."

## Plan Amplification

Create a strategy to increase impact while maintaining coherence:

- **Focal point**: What should be the hero moment? (Pick ONE, make it amazing)
- **Personality direction**: Maximalist chaos? Elegant drama? Playful energy? Dark moody? Choose a lane.
- **Risk budget**: How experimental can we be? Push boundaries within constraints.
- **Hierarchy amplification**: Make big things BIGGER, small things smaller (increase contrast)

**IMPORTANT**: Bold design must still be usable. Impact without function is just decoration.

## Amplify the Design

Systematically increase impact across these dimensions:

### Typography Amplification
- **Replace generic fonts**: Swap system fonts for distinctive choices (see the parent skill's typography guidelines and [typography.md](typography.md) for inspiration)
- **Extreme scale**: Create dramatic size jumps (3x-5x differences, not 1.5x)
- **Weight contrast**: Pair 900 weights with 200 weights, not 600 with 400
- **Unexpected choices**: Variable fonts, display fonts for headlines, condensed/extended widths, monospace as intentional accent (not as lazy "dev tool" default)

### Color Intensification
- **Increase saturation**: Shift to more vibrant, energetic colors (but not neon)
- **Bold palette**: Introduce unexpected color combinations. Avoid the purple-blue gradient AI slop
- **Dominant color strategy**: Let one bold color own 60% of the design
- **Sharp accents**: High-contrast accent colors that pop
- **Tinted neutrals**: Replace pure grays with tinted grays that harmonize with your palette
- **Rich gradients**: Intentional multi-stop gradients (not generic purple-to-blue)

### Spatial Drama
- **Extreme scale jumps**: Make important elements 3-5x larger than surroundings
- **Break the grid**: Let hero elements escape containers and cross boundaries
- **Asymmetric layouts**: Replace centered, balanced layouts with tension-filled asymmetry
- **Generous space**: Use white space dramatically (100-200px gaps, not 20-40px)
- **Overlap**: Layer elements intentionally for depth

### Visual Effects
- **Dramatic shadows**: Large, soft shadows for elevation (but not generic drop shadows on rounded rectangles)
- **Background treatments**: Mesh patterns, noise textures, geometric patterns, intentional gradients (not purple-to-blue)
- **Texture & depth**: Grain, halftone, duotone, layered elements. NOT glassmorphism (it's overused AI slop)
- **Borders & frames**: Thick borders, decorative frames, custom shapes (not rounded rectangles with colored border on one side)
- **Custom elements**: Illustrative elements, custom icons, decorative details that reinforce brand

### Motion & Animation
- **Entrance choreography**: Staggered, dramatic page load animations with 50-100ms delays
- **Scroll effects**: Parallax, reveal animations, scroll-triggered sequences
- **Micro-interactions**: Satisfying hover effects, click feedback, state changes
- **Transitions**: Smooth, noticeable transitions using ease-out-quart/quint/expo (not bounce or elastic, which cheapen the effect)

### Composition Boldness
- **Hero moments**: Create clear focal points with dramatic treatment
- **Diagonal flows**: Escape horizontal/vertical rigidity with diagonal arrangements
- **Full-bleed elements**: Use full viewport width/height for impact
- **Unexpected proportions**: Golden ratio? Throw it out. Try 70/30, 80/20 splits

**NEVER**:
- Add effects randomly without purpose (chaos ≠ bold)
- Sacrifice readability for aesthetics (body text must be readable)
- Make everything bold (then nothing is bold; you need contrast)
- Ignore accessibility (bold design must still meet WCAG standards)
- Overwhelm with motion (animation fatigue is real)
- Copy trendy aesthetics blindly (bold means distinctive, not derivative)

## Verify Quality

Ensure amplification maintains usability and coherence:

- **NOT AI slop**: Does this look like every other AI-generated "bold" design? If yes, start over.
- **Still functional**: Can users accomplish tasks without distraction?
- **Coherent**: Does everything feel intentional and unified?
- **Memorable**: Will users remember this experience?
- **Performant**: Do all these effects run smoothly?
- **Accessible**: Does it still meet accessibility standards?

**The test**: If you showed this to someone and said "AI made this bolder," would they believe you immediately? If yes, you've failed. Bold means distinctive, not "more AI effects."

When the result feels right, hand off to `$impeccable-flutter polish` for the final pass.
